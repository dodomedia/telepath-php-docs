Introduction
============

‚ùì There are a lot of PHP libraries that enable you to interact with Telegram. So why do we need another one?

### But which library is the best?

That depends quite honestly on how you want to use it. There are a lot of useful Telegram libraries, each with a
different approach on how you can use it.

- [Nutgram](https://nutgram.dev/):
  Nutgram is quite similar to this library although some aspects are completely different...
- [PHP Telegram Bot](https://github.com/php-telegram-bot/core):
  PHP Telegram Bot was my goto library before I wrote my own.
  _Disclaimer: I'm a maintainer there too._
